General overview of algorithm
 
1.  Match symbols to chars in word.
     a. Build a string with equal number of chars to word and fill it in with non alpha char. 
     ( word = element -> fill-word = ???????)
     b. Place each matching symbol in its own fill-word string
              i.  Ex: word = cures -> C???? Cu??? ??Re? ????S ?U???
2.  Ensure each char column is filled
     a. If a column yields 0 it is automatic fail
3.  Check to see if there is capitalized variation in char column
     a. Identify char columns with no variation
     b. Identify char columns with variation
4.  Build bit-wise truth table for word variations
     a. possible variations = 2^n where n is the number of char column variations
5.  Eliminate fail cases
     a.  Two lower case chars in a row
     b.  Two upper case chars in a row where first char is not element symbol
6. Ensure that all cases were not eliminated
    a. If all cases fail it is a fail (*see Note1 below.)
    b. Otherwise...store results!!

*Note1.) It is possible a case is crossed out and no matching cases are found
a.)--let's assume Ti and In are only possible symbols
b.)--word = tin -> Ti In -> Tin=fail , TIn=fail  
c.)--even though matches are found and length is filled, it still fails
