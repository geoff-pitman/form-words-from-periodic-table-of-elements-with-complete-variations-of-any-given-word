*since there really shouldn't be any cases of 3 char symbols
     I've prevented that part of the code from executing unless 
     a quick check is passed and the UuX flag gets flipped on.  
     It basically has it's own algorithm, because the 1 and 2 
     char symbol algorithm runs much faster without the overhead
     of doing a 3 char symbol check, which theoretically will 
     never happen (because there are no words in the English 
     language that contain 1 of the 4 matching UuX symbols AND
     can be fully formed. Ex: muumuus -> ?UU?Uus, ?UU?UUS)
*need a more specific 3-char-symbol routine bucket list
*need to identify patterns for adjacent letters

find out if:
a. word can be formed only with the 3 char
b. word can be formed anyway

if a:
examine adjacet letters that could possibly be affected
search through element lists again
add to results 
skip main processing alg

if b:
flag UuX check
go to main processing alg
after results are processed
examine adjacet letters that could possibly be affected
search through element lists again
add to results
